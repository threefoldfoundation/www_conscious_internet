<br>

We aim to empower 1+ Billion people with access to the internet allowing everyone a chance to exchange value, goods and information for less than $1 per month.

<br>

Independent of location, race, gender, religion, we leave no one behind so that everyone can deliver services and goods to everyone in all transparency and fairness.

<br>

Instead of competing, we collaborate with one another to improve our solutions, efficiency, reach, visibility and our service to the planet and humanity.
