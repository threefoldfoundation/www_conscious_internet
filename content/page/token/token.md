# A CIRCULAR ECONOMY
</br>

TFTs are created in the moment when the ThreeFold Grid is expanded by capacity in the form of hardware. This is done by Farmers, who receive TFT in exchange. Through exchanges, TFT is brought to the users of the ThreeFold Grid, who then buy capacity to host their applications with it.
