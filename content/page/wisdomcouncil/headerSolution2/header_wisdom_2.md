In order to make balanced, fair and effective decisions regarding Three Fold Foundation funds distribution, ThreeFold Foundation has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious communication

This process is based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the Members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the Mission and for the good of all.
<br />
<br />
<h3>MISSION</h3>
Financially support consciously aligned do-good projects and organizations.
<br />
<br />
<h3>MEMBERS</h3>
Wisdom Council Members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes and other respectful characteristics.
<br />
<br />
<h3>RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
Based upon the ageless principles of the Wisdom Council equation, Members will converge (online or live when possible) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Foundation to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.
<br />
<br />
<h3>PROCESS</h3>
The Wisdom Council members will be notified once per quarter as to the current do-good requests and account financial status to decide when to meet and make distribution decisions of how much, when and to whom the agreed funds go to.
