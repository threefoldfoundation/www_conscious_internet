Rishi Chidananda has spent the latter part of his life, as a monk, studying the philosophical traditions of India, gaining deep insights into its hidden meaning and timeless practices that are particularly relevant in this day and age. Before entering the spiritual path, he was a successful Investment Banker and entrepreneur. Philosophical teachings contained within ancient scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita had a significant impact on how he viewed the world and changed the way he approached life. As a former Investment Banker and Entrepreneur, he uses his experience to easily articulate the philosophical teachings of the East in a meaningful way for those looking to bridge the gap between Western and Eastern philosophies.
