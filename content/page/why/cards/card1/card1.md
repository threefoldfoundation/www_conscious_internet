excerpt: We created a complete peer-to-peer architecture that can assist the world in it's journey towards decentralization. Blockchain and edge computing were only steps towards that end goal. Our model removes complexity and inefficiencies. No intermediaries. No marketing. No gimmicks. Everything is automated. Completely end-to-end. But it doesn't end there. Users get full control over their data with 100% security and privacy. Not even ThreeFold can access it.
