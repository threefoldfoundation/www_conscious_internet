excerpt: The current Internet infrastructure model consumes more than 10% of the world's energy supplies. Most of that power is used to cool down servers that are stacked in large data centers. But this wouldn't be needed in a decentralized model like the ThreeFold Grid. The testing of ThreeFold's Internet infrastructure showed that we could enable between 50 & 99% power savings, while providing better uptime performance to users.
