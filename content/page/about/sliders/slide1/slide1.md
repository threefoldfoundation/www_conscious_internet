**I declare that I have POWER and I need to act NOW**
<BR/>
I believe that I have the power. I won't blame others – governments, society, neighbors etc. I am, as we all, at the source of the problems the world is facing today. I have a responsibility to improve the things I can have an impact on. I can still strive for a comfortable life but I also have to act and help heal the world. If I change my actions towards what I can have a positive impact on, the world will be a better place tomorrow.
