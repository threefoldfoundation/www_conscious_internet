**I declare that NO one should ever be a product**
<br/>
<br/>
I have become a product of a big data machine. Every action I take on social media, Internet searches, etc., is a potential profit for someone else. 
<br/>
I will stop believing that we are getting these services for free. This leads to manipulation and too much of a consumption of our world's resources. 
<br/>
This means I accept to pay for resources I use. 
<br/>
This means I not only stop being a product myslef but will never make another human (or any being) into a product.
