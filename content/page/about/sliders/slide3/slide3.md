**I declare to respect the world's finite RECOURCES**
<br />
I need to be respectful of finite world resources therefore I declare that I will use and produce high quality and sustainable products and services.​​​​​​​ I will actively look to choose and support more sustainable alternatives in the digital world (as much as physical) educating myself and considering the energy consumption and affect on our plane by digital tools I choose to use.
