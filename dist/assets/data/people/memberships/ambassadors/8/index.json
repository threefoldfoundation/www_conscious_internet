The professorships gives him the responsibility to talk to the next active generation and to transfer the desire to learn and to make the best use out of what we have. Culture in all forms is for Paolo, actually working in materials for clean energy, a renewable and precious source of power. His main aim is to contribute to reunify art, science, and relationships, because these define our 'being human in a natural world'. Gathering people in special events to communicate and inspire has been something Paolo learned in numerous past experiences. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold To change is possible, it is always a possible way in front of us, but to change is an opportunity to wisely use. When a change is felt positive, it is because of a new balance between us and the place and time in which we live has increased and this change can be called improvement. Transforming the economy seems impossible, but we made it the way it is today and we are the only element in the universe able to improve it by making it more natural. The ThreeFold Token project is for me a clear step forward in this direction heading to a more balanced future to be profited by all of us.","excerpt":"Paolo has constantly been forming and training himself in both natural and human sciences.","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-piccardo-87a87a6/","websites":"https://threefold.io/","countries":["Italy"],"cities":[],"private":1,"image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/paolo_piccardo_processed.a658c2f.7cb4797b15c397a98265aaac42c83a82.jpg","size":{"width":252,"height":252},"sizes":"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px","srcset":["/assets/static/paolo_piccardo_processed.a658c2f.7cb4797b15c397a98265aaac42c83a82.jpg 252w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 252 252' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-03a806f3d3e8aa4c8aac77578aa373fd'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-03a806f3d3e8aa4c8aac77578aa373fd)' width='252' height='252' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABAAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUEBgcIAwL/xAAyEAACAQIEBAQEBQUAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFEiEGMUFRBxMiYRRxgaEjQlKRsQgVMsHh/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQAAgUB/8QAHxEAAgICAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEhBBIxMkFR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDqnAcA5YDyxCHIXjHGnE/i5nUVNWPCKQJAx6kqqhlHYXJ%2b/fC2k8O3rQvkV8IjGzK6kG3z/fH1x1MmW%2bKPE9TURMhkzJlVY7k7gG9vfFm4K4iyqeRokEy1AF9Mq2Pvb2xkcm21Sbh4PVQh136Jc34DEMSs2ZN5gA8pYwAiH2Ha/wBcLvD3OZ/D7xKy%2bX4pJKapK0lSW28yJmG57FSQb%2b2LNxbxVlNPWPAIZ5qkGzaALAnuTjPaxUzatoqunRkm%2bKWErIATp5m4Ox5Y5xrrU8z%2bTtlcWsR9O7hgxGyxpHy2ladtUpiQu1rXbSLm3TfEnGwhAMGDBiEOa/G3h6GHxHknqAr02bU6SFBsQ6eg/wAKcVmkyqPLuIMqWnKmYyXXSoXnzJt3xqP9R0dLFHw9XPUxR1Uc7wiIt63RgCWA7AqL/PGO1U1UM5ikDMkkT6lmRgb/AH5Wxj8qLVrSemaFEk4LWxzT5bDmOY1iTyJ5rSmRkdQdRFxcA9uWPPhbIIs48RMiyiG0FNFMZXAF/RGNRG3fl9cQadasVk0ivcM3mPM7i4Y9Rbl12xafB/MMopPElqrNa6KncxNT0fmA2llcgWvyHpHXvgdEW7Em9F7ZJQetnTY2AwYMGNwzCJmeZUeV05nzCpip4uWqRrXPYdziozeIVHVM1Nk9PUT1bHSjvHaIe5N/sMUpRVZ9Xf3HOXEtSdlQX0RD9KDp/JwyOXQTUzQSIdGoMQpI374TnyHnEQih/TL/AB%2boauoloK6pmkkqPiD6rmwGm%2bw6D2xT8ozGSjVviYPOjYjfTqtjYeMMjq67JEpoozN8K/mx39RZSCCvz3xm9Pl7xOxiUrGTYqen0/1hG2z8kN0xWNC3Nc5mroFo8up2jUm5OmwGEC5ZNJmcUmt/wirEg9Qb3xoEdE8ikAoNugx75Vw3UVdR8LSBWlf1EtsFHVmPYYFG3rqISUE/o1zJeIs0yECmqFkzGl8rzEV3/FXfdQx527H98Wfh/jnKs3kWnkZqKsY2WCo9Jb5HkT7YpFNHI8slXJI%2bvQABf02G1wOnXETM6CKqifzUWzb7jD8L5R0xJwTPShYqsTXt%2bRvdl/5hurhXBFtN7c%2b%2bEm6VTxKpIkCVCD22BH8YdRQSMlig22PqH0wJliVExQ3I1AE3B6g8xhDxlkAqIZczoIlug1SqvN1/UR3H3Hyw/igl1AkAdP8AIYl04lg9RClDsy36YrKPZYZ2MuryjFoG1ShI11SE6VVeZPQfXGm5FkUWU0b/ABB8ytlCmVr7Aj8o9gdv3OIuW8JJR8ZVGYDSKBAJYU6rIb3HyA3HzHbFhnimlvpAVTvubHFIVddsvZZ20hbOdSScrMwUW7YgVkgCuByAw0mo5CAAyAC554WV1G4hdi6HS4Deq22x274IkDyf/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"path":"/people/peter_kraft/","content":"\n","name":"Peter Kraft","rank":1,"memberships":[{"id":"ambassadors","title":"ambassadors","path":"/people/memberships/ambassadors/"}],"bio":"I worked 35 years for HP/HPE as sales/product manager/EMEA Director for Business Critical Server Business,last 10 years as EMEA Mission Critical Server Presales Manager, where I managed an EMEA team of presales specialists who nursed new technologies entering the market as well as managed mature technologies that faced declining business. I retired end of 2017, still eagerly following new technologies as I am an engineer with a Mechanical Engineering diploma from TU Graz, Austria. I am married, have 2 adult daughters, love computers and DIY repairs of any kind, my motorbike and Pilates and engage myself in charity clubs since 30 years. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold I learned about ThreeFold from Owen Kemp and Wolfgang Wittmer and was fascinated immediately by the TF approach. Although being a manager almost all of the time of my business life, I am “technology affine” and always interested in new technologies and advances in IT technology, which I follow closely. In HPE, for example, I was also an evangelist for MDC – Memory Driven Compute – a fundamentally new approach to compute architecture based on HP’s famous “The Machine” lab project (see www.labs.hpe.com/the-machine ). I like the idea to build a digitally responsible internet as well as taking social responsibility to bring affordable compute resources to the world, especially the 3rd world. I followed grid and blockchain technologies from the early days (on a high level, not as a programmer, which I am not) and I am happy to see that there are now realistically useable and reasonable approaches like TF proposes. I understand that this is all still in early stages and this is why I want to become a TF Ambassador, Contributing to the community and helping to find business opportunities and other potential contributors and supporters in my own personal network. I am eager to become part of the TF community to learn more about this exciting new approach.","excerpt":"Worked 35 years for HP/HPE as sales/product manager/EMEA Director for Business Critical Server Business.","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-kraft-3775931/","websites":"https://threefold.io/","countries":["Austrian"],"cities":[],"private":1,"image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/peter_kraf_processed.39a2979.3fe7545b5fdcb73590e0374fcaa48eb1.jpg","size":{"width":250,"height":250},"sizes":"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px","srcset":["/assets/static/peter_kraf_processed.39a2979.3fe7545b5fdcb73590e0374fcaa48eb1.jpg 250w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 250 250' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-4d424d9c7d5dbf352f0738f36e630d9f'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-4d424d9c7d5dbf352f0738f36e630d9f)' width='250' height='250' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b6rh/oftUa3/q9UufpwC5B3mrqKojsi7QJ0a52/T19fMliUO7jPOHLjKxkd2o81JyMAnfcb1e9IqwYZELZSpwYUUUVtNZUvb6nxkezwFK/ZKW4%2btONzwhKRv/vNJ9NW9tmIgNNjlz9a5/SATLiptE6GyiQVqVHU2skY%2bvi/CTt9qbIEyWz3fdKlKWBhbgKUt59AjGSPmjLxNTjJilk%2blNpLW2SoucLecbZIxTTeGmjHWocJIG%2bOY96bXL1dJ8KKlQjoEpKyA2FZyNwCScYOD0pLITNEIISwyworCAponOCceZJ5nfpUehTtmWF2xnErDXLjtqu8OXD/AGfhld8lSeZ83F/xWw4ryJMZp9vdDiAtPsRkVld/Tkt6%2bKYm3NyaA2oKWptDYCcHICQP%2b960vpNS1aatpcSEkMISMegGAfwBSts4I0wu5pEDX5jtRRUX11rzT2h4HidQ3BDClDLUdHned/kQNz78h1NVSOc9pVv8fo64KQlJfiIMtkkfU35sfIBT81WFnU3Js6lR3Xe7WgYTkA8J6ZxnGPvUK1h%2bk3LmMPxdNWFphpxJQH56w4og/wCmPLy6Emvnsq1Y3erA/FeKI1waUcBKfLg54cD0xgfFQ3qkAOIl0%2bsFyh5lgtNtC2RAySS2COEJI4N9s%2bnxSxxaC2lSkrW4jdKycj8dDTDGkXR6KGPDx0LzjvFOOKJ5b8OQP/ac4sdUCAWXHVuuqVutas/fb0o0nSNoo2QMn%2b/EjDj7rGo3FNbvvo7ttGMqUrIwAOvxWiLUwYtsiML/AHmmkIPuAAaxd2szfHvFLaiO7UpbaknBBHIg/muns17dtSaPktxro%2b7e7ONixJXl1serbh3%2bDke1LWlErTDnmEX1YM3bHH7m4FqCElSiAkDJJ6CvPjtU1A7q3X14uzq1LbW8Wo%2bfpZQcIA%2bBn3JrcnaTchaNA3%2bdxcJahucJ/iKeEf1Irz3JzzNWCHxOpspGc5FS3Tz8m1NRJsZwNud6eLI2Ug4GD%2bAfio00Ap1KFkJQdyT0HWl7F0K5RQ8oiKrZKDyT6V1RUbKvztPCzIQy8TRlm1pDEceNbebkAAFAQSM%2boI5ik13vb1zVwsFUeKkHiWThRHX22qv9NXplTaI8t0IdxwtPKPlX6BR6H35116rvbklDkGKoBJ2eW2dj/CD/AHNDjp1U1u1j78fMaa%2bpdnuZz48/EYdXzRJW662MNAFLf8o2FQBac74zT9NlJWt6M2eJIQdwdsjnj/OlMYzTFRVTCJ7DaCh2cl29zP/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"path":"/people/peter_richter/","content":"\n","name":"Peter Richter","rank":1,"memberships":[{"id":"ambassadors","title":"ambassadors","path":"/people/memberships/ambassadors/"}],"bio":"Born in Belgium, from German/Dutch descent, Peter is a German citizen with a 25+ year background in Logistics & Supply Chain, of which the last 15 years managing the Supply Chain for Ferrero Russia.
