I'm Turkish, I've lived 9 years in Ankara, 1 year in Florida, 9 years in Istanbul, and the last 1.5 years in London respectively. Current affairs and political economy are of great interest to me, I've been involved in journalism in Turkey and various political clubs/campaigns throughout my high school and college life. As I spent most of my childhood in Istanbul, developmental economics also excites me as Istanbul is a unique example that portrays development in the modern world. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold ThreeFold combines multiple interests that I possess and synthesises a unique, simple yet revolutionary solution to one of the most common problems of the modern age. ThreeFold indeed combines three of my areas of interest, energy consumption, impact of technology on society, and developmental economics. I am fascinated by the energy sector as I find energy to be power in raw form, and the reduced electricity consumption that the ThreeFold grid provides is relevant in an age of development. I am also excited by the impact of technology on society. The potential that ThreeFold provides by standing up against storage capacity monopolies and offering viable access to storage facilities is crucial in the democratisation of the internet, therefore making new opportunities that emerge more compatible with the needs of our society. Finally, the farming aspect of ThreeFold and the availability of storage and internet access in parts of the world in need will help developing parts of the world catch up with the rest of the world. All in all, I see ThreeFold as an opportunity to expand my knowledge in the aforementioned areas by working actively and gaining experience in the professional field.","excerpt":"I'm Efe Aydog and I study Politics, Economics and French at the European Social and Political Studies department of University College London.","linkedin":"","websites":"","countries":["Turkey"],"cities":[],"private":1,"image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/can_efe_aydog.36a08ae.14fac2e886fec88cdad20615908f9897.jpg","size":{"width":640,"height":640},"sizes":"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px","srcset":["/assets/static/can_efe_aydog.36a08ae.14fac2e886fec88cdad20615908f9897.jpg 640w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 640 640' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-d2837471a95b87b2882f17a787ec69da'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-d2837471a95b87b2882f17a787ec69da)' width='640' height='640' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bW4yXQQyhBBHuTSd97hLbwhqijqLPk2K1doa5tyCq4woEljgShoKaVg%2bSiSP1FPXRGsrTrK2d7tDxKkYDrC8BbRPQgfyOBqnVw2Q6kiSlpiLZfRyCyvdyBy4VLbP39QbM9WxJtwhqbiOOJafKV5QtCiAR/Y9RRQtx5yXOiX1wXSorCSFJBByDWaaFAoooqEK1dqRv8Xu9k7s1IkswFqZkoYQVrBWUHwp%2bo7oNDGt7Fp23NQozM51loloLU2E5IOCACRnj5Uytc2Xut%2bbuoSsRioOLOMoQrdwT7nArQLquBJkuITGZdbdWSPiAJUlRPtyz7VlWd9jVi4NemCjFSqfJMQL5BuMATGXdxkcVb3Ap9x0qB1v8AC1DYYkS0uNy1zprEdCmVBWCVc/sAaipWiLclhmVJQ8h54rbdWw4rDaN0bgx6YPHGfEelbLs30yYutrQ7Z5S1xWS45K32woFAbKUgk/VvHgefOjhGMsYCtnOMXlD9YbDTKGwSQhISCfSudFFaRjBUbdb9abQ2pd0ucKGlIyS%2b%2blH8mqv7Q9r97vSnmo0hVst6spEdhWFqH%2ba%2bZ9hge9KF4/ii0B3JClZUTxKgPWue/wCA9pcDUevNO6pskyFpy5InvNlC3FNNr3Ep3sZ3yADy6Gl3c7I53z45fWhpwYcaCgQT0WAf%2b11bC4zM7RGpkMAd6ZltDAH0hvIT%2b6vvipB%2b792nKiLhGWwn5VjG8n040ja5O78NHSSjGDyZ7rKbhfCMhKooRkuOqIUkjlgf2TTe2cwGo%2bno8tLiHly0B0OJUFAoPy4I6dfvSsu8lMDTNxvtyaEe3RGFKbbVzfdUN1CB55UR%2b9IvQm2TU%2bgbWmDb3Ysq3Be8mPLQVhBPMIIIKQeeOWabpqfuaOGqv3dkS%2bNFLbZLtdsW0OKlphQg3pKcuwHVeI%2bamz9af3HUUya7iR81ZNzVIeJcOaI09xs7jZ3QrmagGXCSpSjzNepboDSik/SarYXkslsSuz%2bltn15ucZlLs2a2JaEuglGN9SAVAccYxw6mpzZ3fxfdUum7Wxtxt5S0NS2xupDiTgBQ4DxccYHAj1zS/iXVmFs6jtrKQ/JhtIab3kpJCPIK4HCiOHWt00/MYtWzeLOLbafgMqWoAjIWFKzyJ45GOdXCMU3JltvGEar2ktVrnXxjTsdwCFAAdeQg/M6ocAT13Un/akZLLah48lKTkVI3J2RLlyJUhann33FOuLUclSlHJP6moOWsrWB9Kevma6t%2bgPB6LXMkQ5jcqG65HfaUFtuNqKVII5EEcjVyOz/ALYnNVhqw6lUBeQn8iSBgSQBnChyC8DPkffnTFpSWcF08eifL3pp7BC/K2nacQxFf8MtKyocgkAkk%2bmBQ4yiH//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},{"node":{"path":"/people/carlos_mario_sanches_avila/","content":"\n","name":"Carlos Mario Sanches Avila","rank":1,"memberships":[{"id":"ambassadors","title":"ambassadors","path":"/people/memberships/ambassadors/"}],"bio":"Mario is the Founder of The 5 ELEMENTS Therapy™ and has been sharing his healing gift all over the world for the past 11 years.
