Yet it is owned by large international companies that exploit users data.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>The current approach of many governments and countries is to cut the Internet into pieces by limiting its accessibility and enforcing regulations. We need an internet that protects our digital freedom and fair access to global information for everyone, everywhere.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>The ThreeFold Grid is a peer-to-peer Internet - owned by its users.

However this is not a viable solution as data centers consume enormous amounts of energy. Therefore, a new solution that can drastically reduce the global internet’s energy consumption is needed.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>The ThreeFold Grid is the first true peer-to-peer Internet. It uses pioneering technologies that removes the need for centralized and power-hungry data centers, consumes 90% less energy, and uses 90% less international fiber network capacity.</p>\n","image":"","order":1}],"cards":[],"contactData":[{"id":"collaborate","title":"collaborate","mail":"support@example.com","phone":"+1 (555) 123-4567"},{"id":"support","title":"support","mail":"support@example.com","phone":"+1 (555) 123-4567"},{"id":"press","title":"Press","mail":"support@example.com","phone":"+1 (555) 123-4567"},{"id":"join","title":"Join our team","mail":"support@example.com","phone":"+1 (555) 123-4567"}],"header":null,"howItWorks":[],"howItWorksMain":null,"productData":null,"featuresMain":null,"logos":[],"features":null,"cta":null,"signup":null,"comparisonMain":null,"comparisonSecs":[]}},"context":{}}
