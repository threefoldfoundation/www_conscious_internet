**I declare that RESPECT is the basis of my communication and ACTION**
<br/>
<br/>
I declare that respect instead of fear or ego, is the basis of my communication and my action in the new digital world.
<br/>
I don't have to always agreeÂ but respect and tolerance for other opinions is a must.<br/>
I need to respect time, e.g. time of others and my own.
